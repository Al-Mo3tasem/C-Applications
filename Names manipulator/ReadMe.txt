Our program is a program that aims to manipulate names, 
1) function print that prints the detailed parts of the name each in one line.

2)function replace(int i,int j) that replaces the name at position I with the name at position j
and return true if operation is valid and false if one of the two indices is out of range.
e.g., “ahmed hassan ali”
replace(1,2) ➔ true ➔ “Hassan ahmed ali”
replace(3,1) ➔ true ➔ “ali Hassan ahmed”
replace(2,4) ➔ false

3)in main function we have 6 test cases I already prepared them.
