- A program that handles an address book program, which process the following functions:

1) Class called PhoneDirectory. Add a first name, last name and phone number entry
as a private.

2) The main program uses a simple text-based interface to give the user access to the directory. In 
a while loop, the program presents the user with a menu of options:

1. Add an entry to the directory
2. Look up an entry by phone number
3. Look up an entry by first name
4. Delete an entry from the directory
5. List All entries in phone directory "in alphabetical order by first name".
6. Exit form this program

NOTE: I made three Sorting techniques which is: Bubble sort, Insertions sort and Selectin sort,

BUT the point is that these functions sort a DOUBLY LINKED LIST! not a normal array.
