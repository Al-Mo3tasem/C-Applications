- A template binary search tree class with this name BSTFCI
and a node class with name BSTNode.
-  BSTFCI class 
-  BSTNode class 


Our operations on tree is: 

(1) Checking Tree Balance:
method called “isBalance” in BSTFCI this method will check in the BST is
balanced or not.

(2)  Tree Comparison:
a function named isSubTree(BSTFCI* t1, BSTFCI* t2), that decides if a BSTFCI T2 is a subtree of another BSTFCI T1.

(3)  Print Range:
a recursive function named printRange in the class BSTFCI that stores
integers and given a low key value and a high key value, it prints in sorted order all
records whose key values fall between the two given keys. Function printRange
visits as few nodes in the BST as possible. I did smart traversal to only traverse the related parts.
