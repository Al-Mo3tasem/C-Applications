- Assume a binary tree. Write a flip method that takes the node which the mirror
image of the tree will start from, if no parameter is sent to the function the default
value will be the root node.


-Example:
 
original tree:          New tree: I choose Node 1 from where I started flipping.
   
       1                              1
     /   \                          /  \
    2     3                       3     2     
  /  \                                  /  \
 4    5                               5     4


- You will find 5 test cases in the main function...
The five test cases are shown in images.
Also the original tree on which I have made the Tests are shown in "our Original tree" image.
